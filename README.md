### Spring Security  examples

#### Example 1 
This is the very basic Spring Batch security that allows you to secure 
a page.

By default using spring batch you will have a /login and /logout pre-formated
that you can use to login and logout.

In this example we have the unsecure page /health and we are applying security 
rules to every other page.

#### Example 2 
This example uses a DB to store the user and passwords.


#### Compiling
To compile all the project at once you have the root pom.xml
